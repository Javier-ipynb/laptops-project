# Project Title:
Prediction of Laptop Prices

# Description:
Through exploratory data analysis and using the available information, we will create a machine learning model that can predict the price of a product as accurately as possible. Additionally, we will address certain questions related to the factors influencing the price increase of certain products.

# Data Acquisition:
The data was obtained from the Kaggle website. It is a dataset intended for educational use and is available for free download. The original data comes from a Spanish website called "PC Componentes," meaning we will not be working with synthetic data. Therefore, the patterns and conclusions we draw from the project will be relevant to this market. The download link and the explanation of each column are included in the project.

# Final Model Performance for the Project:
In the project, I will explain step by step and in detail the features I use for training and the reasons for their selection. The priority in this project was to build a good model that is quick and easy to train, resulting in metrics that surpass most other projects published on the same Kaggle website.
